# Description
The existence of shells is linked to the very existence of IT.
At the time, all coders agreed that communicating with a computer 
using aligned 1/0 switches was seriously irritating.

a computer using interactive lines of commands in a language somewhat close
to english.

In this Minishell, we travel through time and come back to problems
people faced when Windows didnâ€™t exist.
